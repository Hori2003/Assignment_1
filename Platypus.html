      Platypus is well adapted for semi-aquatic lifestyle. Its streamline
      body and a broad, flat tail are covered with dense waterproof fur,
      which provides excellent thermal insulation. The Platypus propels
      itself through the water by using its front, short, webbed limbs,
      and the partially-webbed hind feet act as rudders. Behind its 
      distinctive bill are the grooves that house the ear openings 
      and the eyes which close when the animal dives. The Platypus uses 
      its tail for storage of fat reserves and the strong claws on its feet
       for burrowing and moving on land. In addition, males possess a horny 
       spur on their ankles, which is connected to a venom gland in the upper 
       leg, making the Platypus one of the few venomous mammals.
