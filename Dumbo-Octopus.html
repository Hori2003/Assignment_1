        Dumbo octopuses are semi-translucent and have prominent 
        fins on their bell-shaped bodies (also called a mantle). 
        They have large eyes, but it's not known how good their eyesight is.
        The octopuses also have a single line of about 65-68 suckers
        along each arm. These are flanked by hair-like projections
        called cirri. This places them in the deep-sea cirrate octopus 
        group, which is one of the two main divisions of octopuses. 
        The other division is the incirrate octopuses, which live in 
        shallower waters and do not have cirri on their limbs.
