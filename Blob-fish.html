        Officially known as the Psychrolutes marcidus, the blobfish is 
        part of the fathead sculpin family, which lives in the Pacific, 
        Atlantic, and Indian Oceans anywhere between 330 and 9,200 feet below
        the ocean surface. According to the Australian Museum, the name
        “fathead sculpin” indicates that these fishes typically have a large,
        globular head and floppy skin. And as seen in the image above, blobfish 
        look far less “blobby” when they’re thriving in their natural, 
        cold-water, deep-sea habitat.
